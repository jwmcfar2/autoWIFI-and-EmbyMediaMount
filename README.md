# autoWIFI-and-EmbyMediaMount
An extension of my autoWIFI script - where a single udev USB event triggers my autoWIFI and autoMediaMount scripts. This will allow me to both use a drive to connect to a new wifi network, then auto-mount them to my designated Emby folder location. Then I use symbolic links to match genres to view on Emby.

Please refer to Emby's website for more information about their server software: **https://emby.media/**
